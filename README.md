# Bird Identification using Computer Vision

# Background

Environment Canada and Climate Change Canada fund work that aims tomaintain the diversity and abundance of bird species in Canada. According to Climate Change Canada,“Birds are an integral part of our Canadian heritage. Through bird-watching, and recreational and subsistence hunting, birds make a significant contribution to our quality of life and our economy. They also play important ecological and biological roles in our environment by eating insects, dispersing seeds, and pollinating plants, to name a few. Bird populations are important environmental indicators -the health of our birds tells us much about the health of our planet.”In response to concerns over declining populations of many species of once common birds, Canada, Mexico and the United States formed the North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) in 1999.One of NABCI’s primary objectives between 2019 and 2022 is to develop a tracking systemfor bird conservation in order to facilitate progress reporting and adaptive management.


# Planned approach

Develop a computer vision model that will be able to identify a given bird species from an input image.
Evaluate methods for improving model accuracy (including transfer learning).
